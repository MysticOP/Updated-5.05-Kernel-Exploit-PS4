# Updated-5.05-Kernel-Exploit-PS4
I Have Updated Kernel Exploit For The PS4 Jailbreak Version 5.05 To Fix Crashes And Stability Errors, This is just a temporary project. 

## Patches Included
The following patches are made by default in the kernel ROP chain:
1) Disable kernel write protection
2) Allow RWX (read-write-execute) memory mapping
3) Syscall instruction allowed anywhere
4) Dynamic Resolving (`sys_dynlib_dlsym`) allowed from any process
4) Custom system call #11 (`kexec()`) to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode
5) Allow unprivileged users to call `setuid(0)` successfully. Works as a status check, doubles as a privilege escalation.

## Payloads included
1) Vortex's HEN (Homebrew Enabler)
2) Mira

## Jailbreak Website Links
1) Mira Hen https://cthugha.exploit.menu/

## Notes
- The page will crash on successful kernel exploitation, this is normal
